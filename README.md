# Train Ticket Booking System

## Overview
This is a Java-based Train Ticket Booking System that allows users to sign up, log in, view available trains, book tickets, view their bookings, and cancel tickets. The system uses JSON files for local data storage and the Jackson library for JSON parsing.

## Features
- User Sign Up and Login with password hashing
- View available trains based on source and destination
- Book train tickets
- View user booking history
- Cancel booked tickets
- JSON-based local database for users, trains, and tickets

## Technologies Used
- Java 8+
- Jackson Databind (for JSON serialization/deserialization)
- File-based JSON storage
- Maven (optional for dependency management)

## Project Structure
ticket.booking.entities // Entities like User, Train, Ticket
ticket.booking.services // Business logic for booking, user services
ticket.booking.util // Utility classes like password hashing
localDb // JSON files for storing users, trains, tickets

## Setup Instructions

1. **Ensure JSON files are in place**  
   Place these files inside the `localDb` directory:  
   - `users.json`  
   - `trains.json`  
   - `tickets.json`

2. **Build and Run**  
   Compile and run the main application class or test the service classes as needed.
